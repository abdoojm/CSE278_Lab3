# CSE278_Lab3

These are my files for Lab 3.

## q1.cpp

This program was supposed to take a string input and return the number of letters, digits, and numbers in the word, as well as whether or not the string contained "miami". There was also to be a function that allowed the user to capitalize or send to lowercase all of the letters in the string. However, I did not understand how to do any of that, so my program accepts a string input and tells the user that the rest of the functionality is not provided.

## q2.cpp

This program swaps two integer values using a function.

## q3.cpp

This function was supposed to take an input from the user of an array of integers and then find the local maximums and minimums. While I understand how to do this in theory, and could have written this program in Java in 20 minutes, I was unsure how to complete this task, so the program accepts up to 20 integer values from the user, then tells the user that the rest of the functionality is not provided.
